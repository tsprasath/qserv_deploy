General usage:

    ${0} [OPTIONS]

General options:

    -h|--help
        print this help

    -j|--jemalloc
        run an application with the JEMALLOC library and collect statistics
        into a file to be placed in the debug folder.

Options restricting a scope of the operation:

    -w=<name>|--worker=<name>
        select workers affected by the operation. If '*' is used in place of
        the worker name then all workers will be assumed. Note that single
        quotes are required here in order to prevent the shell from expanding
        the the wildcard symbol into a list of local files in the current
        working directory.

    -m|--master
        master controller

    -d|--db
        database service
